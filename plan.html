        <h2>Plan Your Visit</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Transportation & Airport Info:</strong> Most visitors arrive
            by air via a small airport accommodating jets and propeller planes.
            Taxis and public buses are available. Bike rentals are common and
            helmets are required by law.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Currency and Payments:</strong> Taniti uses the U.S. dollar,
            but euros and yen are accepted. Major credit cards are widely used
            and banks offer currency exchange services.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Local Laws and Safety:</strong> Alcohol sales are banned
            from midnight to 9 AM. The legal drinking age is 18, but enforcement
            is lax. Pickpocketing has increased with tourismâ€”remain cautious in
            crowds.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Transit and Holidays:</strong> Public buses in Taniti City
            run daily from 5 AM to 11 PM. Many businesses close during national
            holidays, so plan ahead.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Language and Healthcare:</strong> Many young residents speak
            English. Rural areas speak primarily local dialects. One hospital
            and several clinics serve tourists with multilingual staff.
